## SidebarSurfer App

The Sidebar and Modal project is a responsive web application that incorporates a sidebar and modal functionality. Users can `toggle the sidebar` to access a menu of links, and `open the modal` to view additional content or perform actions. This project leverages the power of `React Context API`, utilizing global context to manage state values across components.
